GETTING STARTED
===============

Cloning
-------

This repository contains a submodule.
To clone this repository, first clone it as usual, then cd into
the cloned repository and execute the last two submodule more commands:

$ git clone https://github.com/AlericInglewood/3p-libcurl.git 3p-libcurl
$ cd 3p-libcurl
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update

Continue at BUILDING below, unless you actually need
to upgrade the curl version (you'll need repository
write access for that though).

Updating curl-git
--------------------

To update the submodule, simply cd into curl-git and
treat it as a normal git repository.

$ cd curl-git
$ git reset --hard		# Throw away all local changes!
$ git checkout curl-7_39_0_pipelinefix
$ git pull

Register in the superproject that a different checkout is being used:
Don't forget to update the version in autobuild.xml too!

$ cd ..
$ vi autobuild.xml
$ git commit -am 'Updated submodule curl-git to latest curl-7_39_0_pipelinefix'


BUILDING
========

# To build the package:
cd 3p-libcurl
autobuild install	# Install zlib and openssl
autobuild build
autobuild package

The produced package is directly usable for Singularity and
does not need conversion.
